# 22 - Ruby - Strings - Iteration

#  ################################ Problem ################################
#In our encoding tutorial, we learned about the different ways Ruby 1.8 and Ruby 1.9 (and higher versions)
# represent strings internally. The major difference is a wide range of encoding (non-ascii) support
# in the later versions. This change, however, also overhauls the way strings were iterated between the two versions.

# In Ruby 1.8, there's a single each method (remember Enumerable?) which allowed it to iterate over lines of data.
# While it might seem like a logical option to have, how would one go about iterating on
# each byte or each character? It turns out that it was not so clean, and people had to resort to tricks
# for some of these functionalities.

# With Ruby 1.9, each was removed from the String class and is no longer an Enumerable.
# Instead, we have more explicit choices based on what we need to iterate - bytes, chars, lines or codepoints.

# each_byte iterates sequentially through the individual bytes that comprise a string;
# each_char iterates the characters and is more efficient than [] operator or character indexing;
# each_codepoint iterates over the ordinal values of characters in the string;
# each_line iterates the lines.
# For example:

# > money = "Â¥1000"
# > money.each_byte {|x| p x} # first char represented by two bytes
# 194
# 165
# 49
# 48
# 48
# 48
# > money.each_char {|x| p x} # prints each character
# "Â¥"
# "1"
# "0"
# "0"
# "0"
# Without a doubt, Ruby 1.9 makes iteration easier to understand and implement.
# Hence, we'll stick with Ruby 1.9 and later versions for current and other challenges (unless otherwise stated).

# Challenge: Write the method count_multibyte_char which takes a string as input and
# returns the number of multibyte characters (byte size > 1) in it.

# For example:

# > count_multibyte_char('Â¥1000')
# 1

# solution
def count_multibyte_char(str)
  character_count = 0
  str.each_char do |char|
    byte_count = 0
    char.each_byte do |byte|
      byte_count += 1
    end
    if byte_count > 1
      character_count += 1
    end
  end
  return character_count
end
