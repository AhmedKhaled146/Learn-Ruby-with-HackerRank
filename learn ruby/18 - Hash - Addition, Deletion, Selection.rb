#  18 - Ruby Hash - Addition, Deletion, Selection

#  ################################ Problem ################################
# In this challenge, we will show you ways in which we can add key-value pairs to Hash objects,
# delete keys from them, and retain them based on a logic.

# Consider the following Hash object:

# h = Hash.new
# h.default = 0
# A new key-value pair can be added using or the store method

# h[key] = value

# or

# h.store(key, value)
# An existing key can be deleted using the delete method

# h.delete(key)

# For destructive selection and deletion, we can use keep_if and delete_if as seen in Array-Selection

# > h = {1 => 1, 2 => 4, 3 => 9, 4 => 16, 5 => 25}
#  => {1 => 1, 2 => 4, 3 => 9, 4 => 16, 5 => 25}
# > h.keep_if {|key, value| key % 2 == 0} # or h.delete_if {|key, value| key % 2 != 0}
#  => {2 => 4, 4 => 16}
# Note

# For non-destructive selection or rejection, we can use select, reject, and drop_while similar to Array-Selection

# In this challenge, a hash object called hackerrank is already created. You have to add

# A key-value pair [543121, 100] to the hackerrank object using store
# Retain all key-value pairs where keys are Integers ( clue : is_a? Integer )
# Delete all key-value pairs where keys are even-valued.

# Enter your code here.
hackerrank.store(543121, 100)
hackerrank.keep_if {|key, value| key.is_a? Integer }
hackerrank.delete_if {|key, value| key % 2 == 0}
