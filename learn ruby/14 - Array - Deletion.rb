# #  14 - Ruby Array - Deletion
#
#  ################################ Problem ################################
# The array class has various methods of removing elements from the array.

# Let's look at the array
#
#  arr = [5, 6, 5, 4, 3, 1, 2, 5, 4, 3, 3, 3]
# Delete an element from the end of the array
#  > arr.pop
#  => 3
# Delete an element from the beginning of the array
#  > arr.shift
#  => 5
# Delete an element at a given position
#  > arr.delete_at(2)
#  => 4
# Delete all occurrences of a given element
#  > arr.delete(5)
#  => 5
#  > arr
#  => [6, 3, 1, 2, 4, 3, 3]
# Your task is to complete the functions below using syntax as explained above.

# solution

def end_arr_delete(arr)
  # delete the element from the end of the array and return the deleted element
  arr.pop
end

def start_arr_delete(arr)
  # delete the element at the beginning of the array and return the deleted element
  arr.shift
end

def delete_at_arr(arr, index)
  # delete the element at the position #index
  arr.delete_at(index)
end

def delete_all(arr, val)
  # delete all the elements of the array where element = val
  arr.delete(val)
end
