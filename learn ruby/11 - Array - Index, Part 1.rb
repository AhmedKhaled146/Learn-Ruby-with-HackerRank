# # 11 - Ruby Array - Index, Part 1
#
# #  ################################ Problem ################################
# Array collections offer various ways to access their elements.

#   The positions are 0 indexed. Objects of the array can be accessed using the []
# method which may take various arguments, as explained below.

#   arr = [9, 5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 0, -1]
# A number which is the position of element
# >>arr[4]
# => 3
# or

#   >>arr.at(4)
# => 3
# A range indicating the start and the end position
# >>arr[1..3] # .. indicates both indices are inclusive.
# => [5,1,2]
# >>arr[1...3] # ... indicates the last index is excluded.
# => [5,1]
# Start index and the length of the range
# >>arr[1,4]
# => [5, 1, 2, 3]
# For this challenge, your task is to complete the functions using syntax as explained above.

# solution
def element_at(arr, index)
  # return the element of the Array variable `arr` at the position `index`
  # arr.at(index) # or
  # arr[index]
  arr[index]
end

def inclusive_range(arr, start_pos, end_pos)
  # return the elements of the Array variable `arr` between the start_pos and end_pos (both inclusive)
  arr[start_pos..end_pos]
end

def non_inclusive_range(arr, start_pos, end_pos)
  # return the elements of the Array variable `arr`, start_pos inclusive and end_pos exclusive
  arr[start_pos...end_pos]
end

def start_and_length(arr, start_pos, length)
  # return `length` elements of the Array variable `arr` starting from `start_pos`
  arr[start_pos, length]
end
