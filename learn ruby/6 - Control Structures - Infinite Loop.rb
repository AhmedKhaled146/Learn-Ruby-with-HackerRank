# #  6 - Ruby Control Structures - Infinite Loop

# ################################ Problem ################################
# This is a wonderful exercise which explains the concept of infinite loops.

# "A hacker practices on HackerRank until getting to a rating of O(1) read as (Oh-one)"

# An infinite loop in Ruby is of the form

# loop do
# end
# Use an infinite loop and call the method coder.practice within it and break if coder.oh_one? is true.

# break if conditions in Ruby are of the form

# if <condition>
#     break
# end
# or a one-liner

# break if <condition>

#solution
loop do
  coder.practice()
  if coder.oh_one? == true
    break
  end
end
