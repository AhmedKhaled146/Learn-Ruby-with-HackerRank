# #  16 - Ruby Hash - Initialization
#
#  ################################ Problem ################################
# Hashes, also called associative arrays, are dictionary-like data structures which are similar to arrays.
# Instead of using integers to index an object, however, hashes use any object as its index.

# In this challenge, your task is to create three different Hash collections as explained below.

# Initialize an empty Hash with the variable name empty_hash
# Hint

# empty_hash = Hash.new
# Initialize an empty Hash with the variable name default_hash and the default value of every key set to 1.
# Hint

# default_hash = Hash.new(1)
# or

# default_hash = Hash.new
# default_hash.default = 1
# Initialize a hash with the variable name hackerrank and having the key-value pairs

# "simmy", 100
# "vivmbbs",200
# Hint

# hackerrank = {"simmy" => 100, "vivmbbs" => 200}
# Hash can be defined using a new method

# hackerrank = Hash.new
# hackerrank["simmy"] = 100
# hackerrank["vivmbbs"] = 200

# solution_1

# Initialize 3 variables here as explained in the problem statement
empty_hash = Hash.new
default_hash = Hash.new(1)
hackerrank = {"simmy" => 100, "vivmbbs" => 200}

# solution_2

# Initialize 3 variables here as explained in the problem statement
empty_hash = Hash.new
default_hash = Hash.new
default_hash.default = 1
hackerrank = Hash.new
hackerrank["simmy"] = 100
hackerrank["vivmbbs"] = 200
