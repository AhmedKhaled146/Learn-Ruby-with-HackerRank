# #  9 - Ruby Control Structures - Each

#  ################################ Problem ################################
# Ruby offers control structures that let you iterate through its collections. One such control structure is each.

# As you already know, HackerRank conducts many contests, and for every user who participates in a contest
# we update their score once the contest ends. You will be given a method called scoring with an array
# passed as an argument. Elements of the array are of the class User.

# User class has a method update_score.

# Your task is to iterate through each of the elements in the array using each and call
# the method update_score on every element.

# Hint

# array.each do |user|
#     # call update_score on `user` here
# end

# solution
def scoring(array)
  # iterate through each of the element in array using *each* and call update_score on it
  array.each do |user|
    user.update_score
  end
end
