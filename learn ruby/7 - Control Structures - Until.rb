# # ################################ Problem ################################
# This challenge has a beautiful one-liner answer.

#   "A hacker practices on HackerRank until getting to a rating of O(1) read as (Oh-one)"

# Call the method coder.practice until coder.oh_one? becomes true.

#   until is the logical equivalent of while not.

#   Hint

# while not <condition>
# <code>
# end
# or

#   until <condition>
#   <code>
#   end
# or the beautiful one-liner

# <code> until <condition>

coder.practice until coder.oh_one? == true
